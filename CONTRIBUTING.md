# Contributing to Reciprocal Reviews

Welcome to the contributor guide! This document is represents a ground truth for our process; everyone who contributs to the project should follow its guidelines, so read it carefully.

## Getting started

The first and most important thing to do is to understand the motivations for the project. Read the [reciprocal reviews proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RHirbCdQFxBeCbjAAbba1MJtxDOG4cuml66_xWGgXAI/edit#heading=h.gtlebyp3cvjf) to understand what we're trying to build and why.

Next, read the [design specification](DESIGN.md). This document attempts to articulate the experience of reviewers, editors, and authors, and the functionality that supports it.

Finally, read our [architecture guide](ARCHITECTURE.md), which discusses the key technologies, components, and concepts in the implementation, so you can navigate the implementation.

Finally, if you have questions about anything, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GzdCGzWMrj) and ask away. There's almost certainly something important we've missed here, and your questions will help us know what to add.

## Contributing

At the moment, we are happy to accept the following types of contributions:

- [Bug reports and enhancment ideas](https://github.com/reciprocalreviews/reciprocalapp/issues). Before you submit, make sure there isn't an existing issue for what you want to report.
- [Pull requests](https://github.com/reciprocalreviews/reciprocalapp/pulls). Find an unassigned issue, comment on it to see if it's appropriate to work on, and a maintainer will reply and potentially assign you. If they do, fork, work on the issue, and submit a pull request for review and possible merging.
