<h1>About</h1>

<p>
	We are a volunteer community of academics interested in keeping peer review sustainable, for
	ourselves and our communities. You can learn more about who's contributing and how to contribute
	yourself on <Link to="https://github.com/reciprocalreviews">GitHub</Link>.
</p>

<Note>
	Why ORCID? It's the central way to manage reviewer identity. It's designed for this explicit
	purpose and there's no reason to require another login.
