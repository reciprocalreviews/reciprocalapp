### Introduction 
This Cookie Policy explains how Reciprocal Reviews (“RR”) uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website. By using our website, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy.

You may also wish to review our Privacy Policy, which describes what information we are collecting and how we use and protect it.

### What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used to implement certain features, like personalizing your browsing experience or providing reporting information. Cookies can be “session” cookies (expiring when you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (which remain on your device for a specified period).

Cookies set by the website owner are “first-party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies are used to implement functionality provided by another service (e.g., authentication or analytics) on the owner’s website. The parties that set third-party cookies can recognize your device when it visits other websites that use their services.

### How does RR use cookies?
RR uses cookies for two purposes:

-   *Essential:* These cookies are necessary for the basic functionality of our website. They enable features such as user authentication, security, and session management. They comprise both first-party and third-party cookies and are session cookies (deleted when the browser is closed) unless you explicitly choose to remain logged in across sessions.  
     
-   *Analytics:* These cookies help us understand user behavior to improve our website. These are third-party, persistent cookies.  
    
RR does not use any cookies for advertising purposes.

A full listing of the cookies we use is provided below the section describing how you can register your cookie preferences.

#### How can I manage my cookie preference?
You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences on our cookie preferences page. The preferences page allows you to select whether you accept or reject our Analytics and Customization cookies. Essential cookies cannot be rejected since they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.

You can also control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. However, blocking RR’s essential cookies may impact the functionality of our website, including making it impossible to log in.

#### What cookies does RR use?
*Essential:* **TODO: We use third-party cookies with Supabase ...**

*Analytics:* **TODO: We use third-party cookies to implement analytics features  ...**

#### What about other tracking or local storage technologies?
*Customization:* We use local store to store local preferences (e.g., dark mode) to keep those preferences private.

RR does not store any other information locally on your device or use any other tracking technologies (such as tracking pixels).
