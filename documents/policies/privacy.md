### Introduction and Definitions
Reciprocal Reviews (RR) connects editors to available volunteer reviewers and tracks reviewing and publication activities to ensure that authors are contributing to peer review. Below, we offer a quick overview of the data processing activities that we undertake in pursuit of our goal of supporting sustainable, equitable publication of peer-reviewed articles. This overview uses the following terms:

*Personal data* is any information relating to someone who can be identified by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, or email address.

*Processing of data* refers to any operation performed on personal data, including but not limited to collection, storage, or disclosure.

*Reviewing credit* refers to a token obtained for activities such as reviewing or editing an article and used to submit an article for review.

*Linking to a third party publication venue* involves explicitly selecting that venue as one for which you are willing to review and may submit to.

The data processing activities we undertake include:

-   If you create an account on our submission site, we will use ORCID to authenticate you. Your availability as a reviewer, your reviewing preferences, the third-party publication venues you link to on our site, and your reviewing credits will be associated with your ORCID. This data may be processed to identify you as a potential reviewer, to confirm submissions to connected publication venues, and to complete requests you submit on the site.
    
-   We receive review and submission activities from third-party publication venues that will be associated with your account. This information is processed to track reviewing credits.
    
-   We will respond to queries from third-party publication venues that you have explicitly linked to in order to confirm review credits available (for submission) and to add to your review credit total (for reviews).

-   Your personal data may be processed to help us to improve our website and review-support processes.

-   As part of our operation, your personal data may be disclosed to third-party publication venues that you have linked to. Those venues may be located outside your country of residence, where different data protection standards may apply.

### Legal Basis
RR is committed to ensuring that any processing of personal data is conducted in accordance with applicable data protection laws and that we have a legal basis for processing your data. RR may process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:

*Legitimate Interest*: To support our reviewer identification and crediting activities, we will process your personal data to (a) provide this website and (b) process credits and communicate with publishers about publication, reviewing, and editing activities.

*Consent*: We will process your data to improve our website and publication processes if you have provided explicit consent for us to do so. Consent is revokable at any time.

*Legal Compliance*: RR may be required to process your data to comply with legal obligations imposed by applicable laws and regulations.

### Data Collection and Usage
Your personal information is collected and used as described below for the sole purpose of supporting sustainable, equitable publication of peer-reviewed articles. Your information will not be sold. It will not be shared with third-party sites or services without your explicit consent.

#### Personal Information
*Registration and site services*: RR relies on ORCID to authenticate your login, but we will create a local account for you upon registration. Information we will store with your account and will process to provide site services includes: your ORCID, preferred email, site and reviewing preferences, affiliated third-party publication venues, and the transactions that affect your reviewing credits (e.g., reviewing, submitting an article for review, and transactions between users).

*Reviewing*: RR will process the availability for reviewing preferences that you provide. RR will provide your contact information and expertise to third-party publication venues that you have linked to if they request available reviewers in your area. We will process your history of reviewing credits once a third-party publication venue reports that a review is completed.

*Article submission*: RR will process your available reviewing credits. RR will provide the availability (or lack) of credits to third-party publication venues that you have linked to if they notify us that you have submitted an article for review, and we will process your history of reviewing credits once a third-party publication venue reports that an article has been accepted for review.

*Process Review*: RR may process your name, affiliation, reviewing and submission activity, and expertise metadata provided by ORCID as part of normal process review and improvement.

#### Technical Information, Including Cookies
We and our third party providers (i.e., ORCID, Google analytics) use cookies to collect usage information and to make our site work. We do not use any providers that set cookies for social media or advertising purposes.

Our **Cookie Policy** provides more detailed information about why we use cookies, what data is collected, which cookies are optional, and your ability to choose which cookies are used.

### Data Retention
Your personal information will be retained for as long as you maintain a RR account. If you choose to delete your account, we will delete your reviewing preferences and connections to third-party publication venues. Your history of reviewing credits will be disassociated from your account. It will still be possible to verify that the review was done and credited, but no specific account will be associated with the review. It will not be possible to recover this data should you choose to recreate an account.

Data maintained by third-party publication sites will not be affected by the deletion of the RR account. In particular, third-party publication venues with which you have a relationship may keep you in their reviewer registry and may track information about past reviews and submissions to their site. However, they will no longer be able to obtain information about your reviewing credits or to update your reviewing credits once you have deleted your account with RR.

### Data Security
We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards aligned with industry standards to protect your information from unauthorized use, access, or loss. We also require that third-party service providers acting on our behalf or with whom we share your information also provide appropriate security measures.

Transmission of data over the internet is never entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of information you submit while it is in transit.

### Email Communication
RR will send you an email in response to legitimate activities arising from (a) activity on our website, (b) a paper submission you have made, or (c) editing or reviewing activities that you have agreed to perform.
