# Architecture

_Last revised: 2026-05-10_

This document describes the implementation of the Reciprocal Reviews platform — what runs where, how requests flow, and the conventions contributors should follow when extending it. For the user-facing design and rationale, see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). The two documents are intended to stay in sync; changes to either should be audited against the other.

## Stack

Production runtime dependencies are deliberately small. Only three libraries ship to the browser:

- `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js` — Supabase client (auth, Postgres, Realtime)
- `marked` — Markdown rendering for rich text fields

Everything else is build- or test-time tooling. The full set:

| Concern              | Tool                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend framework   | Svelte 5 (runes) + SvelteKit 2                |
| Language             | TypeScript (strict)                           |
| Hosting              | Vercel via `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`         |
| Database, auth, realtime | Supabase (Postgres + GoTrue + Realtime)   |
| Edge functions       | Supabase Functions (Deno)                     |
| Outbound email       | Resend, fronted by an Edge Function           |
| Unit tests           | Vitest (`src/**/*.unit.ts`)                   |
| Integration tests    | Playwright, Chromium only (`end2end/`)        |
| Locale validation    | `ts-json-schema-generator` + `ajv`            |
| Build runtime        | Node ≥ 22                                     |
| Code style           | Prettier (tabs, single quotes, 100-char lines)|

## Request flow

A typical authenticated request:

```
Browser
  │  cookies (Supabase session)
  ▼
Vercel runtime
  │  hooks.server.ts → createServerClient → getClaims (validate JWT)
  ▼
SvelteKit route (+page.ts / +page.svelte / +server.ts)
  │  getDB() → SupabaseCRUD methods
  ▼
Supabase Postgres (RLS-enforced)
  │
  ├──► Postgres Changes ──► RealtimeChannel ──► invalidateAll()
  │                                              (on subscribed clients)
  │
  └──► (writes to `emails` table) ──► resend / remind Edge Functions ──► Resend API
```

Reads are gated by Postgres row-level security, so the database is the last line of defense regardless of what the client requests. Writes that should produce email enqueue rows in the `emails` table; an Edge Function consumes them and posts to Resend in production (or logs to the console in local dev).

## Authentication

Auth is Supabase email/OTP. The integration is centralized so route code never touches Supabase Auth directly.

- [src/hooks.server.ts](src/hooks.server.ts) creates a per-request Supabase server client from cookies and exposes it on `event.locals.supabase`. It also validates the JWT locally via `getClaims()` before any database query, so unauthenticated traffic never reaches the DB.
- [src/lib/auth/Authentication.ts](src/lib/auth/Authentication.ts) and `src/routes/Auth.svelte` wrap session state for client code. Routes consume auth via `getAuth()`.

ORCID-based login is planned (see DESIGN.md and [#19](https://github.com/reciprocalreviews/reciprocalapp/issues/19)) but not yet implemented.

## Data access

All database I/O goes through an abstract interface, not the Supabase client directly. This keeps route code free of database-specific concerns and makes the backend swappable or mockable.

- The interface is [src/lib/data/CRUD.ts](src/lib/data/CRUD.ts).
- The Supabase implementation is [src/lib/data/SupabaseCRUD.svelte.ts](src/lib/data/SupabaseCRUD.svelte.ts), instantiated in the root layout and exposed via `setDB()` / `getDB()`.
- Every method returns `Result<T> = { data?: T; error?: DBError; notified?: Notification[] }`.
- The `handle()` helper in `src/routes/feedback.svelte.ts` wraps calls and posts errors to the global feedback bus, so route code is typically `await handle(db().someMethod(...))`.

New domain operations should be added as methods on the `CRUD` interface and implemented on `SupabaseCRUD`, never as ad-hoc Supabase calls in a route.

### Atomic operations

Operations that perform more than one write — minting or moving tokens, recording a payment alongside the tokens it moves, provisioning a venue — run as `SECURITY DEFINER` Postgres RPCs so each completes in a single transaction; a connectivity loss can no longer leave partial state (tokens moved with no transaction recorded, a submission with orphaned proposed payments, a half-provisioned venue). The CRUD method resolves/validates inputs (reads), calls the RPC for the atomic write, and surfaces the result. Because `SECURITY DEFINER` bypasses RLS, each RPC re-implements its tables' authorization and anti-self-dealing rules in its own body.

The atomic RPCs are `mint_tokens`, `transfer_tokens`, `approve_transaction`, `create_submission`, `create_volunteer` / `accept_role_invite` (volunteer record plus its welcome grant), and `approve_venue_proposal` ([#136](https://github.com/reciprocalreviews/reciprocalapp/issues/136)), alongside the pre-existing `complete_assignment`, `mark_submission_done`, and `bulk_import_submissions`. Each is defined in a migration and mirrored into the relevant `supabase/schemas/` file so it sits next to the table it operates on.

## Realtime

Pages stay live by subscribing to Postgres change feeds. The wrapper is [src/lib/data/SupabaseRealtime.ts](src/lib/data/SupabaseRealtime.ts):

```ts
getRealtimeChannel(name, supabase, [{ table, filter }, ...], () => invalidateAll());
```

Each subscription declares the tables and row filters it cares about; the callback usually calls `invalidateAll()` to retrigger SvelteKit's load functions. Routes that depend on shared mutable state should add a channel rather than polling.

A consequence to be aware of: `handle()` also calls `invalidateAll()` after every successful write, and realtime callbacks land asynchronously after a write commits. Any component that holds in-progress user input (a partially-typed field, an open form) must keep a local working copy of that input and only sync from the load-function prop when it isn't actively editing — otherwise the next refetch will overwrite the user's input. [src/lib/components/EditableText.svelte](src/lib/components/EditableText.svelte) is the canonical example of this pattern.

## Email pipeline

Server code never calls Resend directly. The producer / consumer split is:

1. **Producer.** Application code (CRUD methods, edge functions) inserts a row into the `emails` table via `emailScholars(scholars, templateKey, args)`.
2. **Consumer — `resend` function.** [supabase/functions/resend/](supabase/functions/resend/) reads the row, looks up the template in [src/email/templates.ts](src/email/templates.ts), substitutes `$1`/`$2`/... placeholders, and posts to the Resend API. In local dev (when `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` points at 127.0.0.1) it logs to the console instead.
3. **Reminder cron — `remind` function.** [supabase/functions/remind/](supabase/functions/remind/) is invoked daily at 22:00 UTC by a `pg_cron` job (`remind-daily`) defined in `supabase/migrations/`. It emails scholars with stale availability (fixed 90-day staleness, 30-day dedupe) and emails admins + minters about unapproved proposed transactions, gated per venue by `venues.transaction_reminder_frequency_days` and stamped to `venues.transaction_reminder_time`. It is the only producer that runs outside the SvelteKit process.

To add a new email: add a key to the `Emails` map in `templates.ts`, then call `emailScholars(...)` from the appropriate CRUD method.

## Database management

The schema is described in two places, both kept in sync:

- [supabase/schemas/](supabase/schemas/) — declarative schema files, one per table. **Authoritative.** DESIGN.md links here. RLS policies live in the same file as the table definition.
- [supabase/migrations/](supabase/migrations/) — timestamped migration history. Required for every schema change.

Workflow for a schema change:

1. Write a migration in `supabase/migrations/`.
2. Update the matching declarative file in `supabase/schemas/`.
3. Run `npm run reset` locally to rebuild the DB and regenerate `src/data/database.ts`.

`src/data/database.ts` is generated by `npm run types` (`supabase gen types typescript --local`). Never edit it by hand.

RLS is enabled on every table. RLS policies are verified by an adversarial pgTAP test suite under [supabase/tests/](supabase/tests/) — one file per table, run with `npm run test:rls` (`supabase test db`). [.github/workflows/rls.yml](.github/workflows/rls.yml) runs it on every pull request and gates the staging/production deploys ([#79](https://github.com/reciprocalreviews/reciprocalapp/issues/79)).

### Submission completion

Submission completion is a guarded action implemented by the `mark_submission_done(submission_id, payment_template, mint_template)` RPC ([supabase/migrations/20260517000000_mark_submission_done.sql](supabase/migrations/20260517000000_mark_submission_done.sql)). It authorizes only priority-0 editors of the submission, validates that every approved non-editor assignment is already completed, and — in one atomic action — compensates every uncompleted priority-0 assignment, flips `submissions.status` to `done`, and stamps `submissions.completed_at`. If the venue cannot cover the total editor payout, it records a single proposed mint sized to the shortfall and returns without changing status; if there are pending non-editor assignments, it returns the blocker list without changing anything.

To enforce this gate, the table-level UPDATE grant is removed from the `authenticated` role and re-granted only on the editable columns — omitting `status` and `completed_at`. (A column-level `REVOKE` alone is a no-op while a table-wide `GRANT ALL` confers UPDATE on every column, so the grant must be narrowed, not merely revoked.) The RPC is `SECURITY DEFINER`, so it is the only path that can write these columns. The same pattern makes `transactions` an immutable record: the table-level UPDATE is revoked and re-granted only on `status`, `tokens`, and the decline fields, locking the identity columns. The result: **done is terminal** — once set there is no API path to revert it, by design.

Per-editor compensation amounts come from `compensation(role, submission_type)`; multi-editor submissions are supported and all priority-0 editor assignments are paid in the same transaction. The RPC returns a structured JSONB result (`completed | blocked | insufficient`) that the application layer narrows with a runtime type guard before dispatching `WorkCompensated` emails (per-recipient, surfaced as notification banners via the `handle()` feedback channel).

### Resubmission links and per-type cost

A submission records its predecessor two ways: `submissions.previous` is an internal foreign key (`on delete set null`) to another submission, preferred wherever the chain is displayed; `submissions.previousid` is the legacy free-text external manuscript ID, retained for predecessors not on the platform (and matched against `externalid` within the same venue only as a fallback). Individual submissions set `previous` from a dropdown of the author's own prior submissions in the venue — choosing one mirrors its external ID into the (then read-only) `previousid` field **and auto-selects the matching revision submission type** (the `submission_types` row whose `revision_of` points at the predecessor's type). A typed external ID that matches one of the author's priors does the same best-effort. `bulk_import_submissions` best-effort resolves each row's `previousid` to an on-platform `previous` (exact `externalid` match within the venue).

Submission cost is **per submission type**: `submission_types.submission_cost` (`not null default 0`); there is no venue-wide submission cost. Each type is a different amount of work, so a resubmission — being its own revision type — simply carries its own cost; no separate resubmission cost exists. Admins edit a type's cost in the submission types table on the venue dashboard. The new-submission form charges the selected type's cost, and the bulk-import RPC sizes the mint by summing each row's submission type cost.

## Locales

Localization is type-driven so the schema cannot drift from the strings:

1. [src/lib/locales/Locale.ts](src/lib/locales/Locale.ts) defines a single `LocaleText` interface — the source of truth for every user-visible string.
2. `npm run locale-schema` runs `ts-json-schema-generator` to emit [src/lib/locales/LocaleText.json](src/lib/locales/LocaleText.json).
3. `npm run locale-validate` runs `ajv` against the per-language JSON files.
4. `npm run locale` does both. Run after any change to `Locale.ts`.

The English locale file lives at [static/locales/en.json](static/locales/en.json). It is loaded server-side in the root layout and exposed via `setLocaleContext()`. Components consume strings through [src/lib/locales/Text.svelte](src/lib/locales/Text.svelte) and locale-typed prop functions:

```svelte
<Text path={(l) => l.page.login.buttons.login} />
<TextField label={(l) => l.page.login.form.email.label} />
```

## Global context

The root layout [src/routes/+layout.svelte](src/routes/+layout.svelte) sets up four context channels consumed throughout the app:

- `setDB()` / `getDB()` — database instance
- `setLocaleContext()` / `getLocaleContext()` — current locale strings
- `setFeedback()` / `getFeedback()` — global error/success notification stack
- `setAuth()` / `getAuth()` — authenticated session and scholar

Plus breadcrumbs and page-header state for the chrome.

## State conventions

- Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) are used throughout.
- Class-based stores (e.g. `SupabaseCRUD`) hold reactive state in `$state` fields. The `.svelte.ts` extension marks a module as rune-aware.
- Prefer `$derived` over `$effect` for computed values; reach for `$effect` only when a true side effect is required.

## Routing

- All routes live under `src/routes/[[lang]]/`. `[[lang]]` is an optional locale prefix that defaults to `en`.
- Dynamic segments use the project's domain identifiers: `[id]` (scholars, currencies), `[venueid]`, `[submissionid]`, `[proposalid]`.
- Route directories may contain `+page.svelte`, `+page.ts`, `+layout.svelte`, `+layout.ts`, plus arbitrary co-located helper Svelte files (e.g. `Roles.svelte`, `NewSubmission.svelte`) when a page is too big for one file.

## UI components

[src/lib/components/](src/lib/components/) is the shared design system: `Button`, `Card`, `Cards`, `Form`, `TextField`, `Slider`, `Tag`, `Tags`, `Page`, `Nav`, `Footer`, `Feedback`, `Loading`, `Dialog`, and so on. New UI should compose these rather than introducing one-off styling. Components accept locale-path functions where they take user-visible text.

## Build and release

- `npm run build` runs [scripts/maybe-updates.js](scripts/maybe-updates.js) first, which invokes `npm run updates` only when `$CI` is set. CI builds regenerate `src/routes/[[lang]]/updates/updates.json` from [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) via [scripts/updates.js](scripts/updates.js); local builds reuse whatever was last committed, so the file doesn't churn on every dev rebuild. Run `npm run updates` manually if you want to regenerate it locally.
- `npm run deploy` merges `dev` → `main` and pushes both branches. The push triggers CI; CI does the actual deploy.
- `package.json#version` is bumped manually as part of changelog updates.

### Deployment pipeline

Vercel's automatic git-deploys are **disabled** for `dev` and `main` (see [vercel.json](vercel.json)`#git.deploymentEnabled`). Deploys are driven by GitHub Actions instead, so a broken push never reaches hosting.

Each branch push triggers a workflow that runs jobs in this order:

```
[unit-tests, playwright, locale-validation, rls-tests]   ── parallel
              │
              ▼ (prod: all pass · staging: not gated)
           migrate         ── supabase db push
              │
              ▼
           vercel          ── vercel pull → build → deploy
```

Migrations are applied before the Vercel deploy so schema changes are in place before the code that depends on them goes live.

- `main` → [.github/workflows/production.yml](.github/workflows/production.yml) deploys to Vercel **production** against the production Supabase project. Here `migrate`/`vercel` **gate on the tests** — if any test fails, neither the migration nor the deploy runs.
- `dev` → [.github/workflows/staging.yml](.github/workflows/staging.yml) deploys to a Vercel **preview** environment against the staging Supabase project. Staging is a throwaway test target, so its deploy is **not gated** on the tests: they still run in parallel for signal, but a red e2e/unit/rls run won't block the preview (it keeps deploys fast and lets the slow e2e suite finish out-of-band). The gate is what keeps a broken change from reaching `main`/production.

Required GitHub secrets: `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `STAGING_DB_PASSWORD`, `STAGING_PROJECT_ID`, `PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD`, `PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID`, `TEST_ENV`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`. Per-environment runtime config (Supabase URL, anon key, Resend key, etc.) lives in Vercel's environment variable settings and is pulled at build time by `vercel pull`.

## Testing

- **Unit.** Vitest. Files matching `src/**/*.unit.ts`. Run with `npm run test:unit`.
- **Integration.** Playwright, Chromium only. Files in `end2end/`. Run with `npm run test:end`. Needs a local Supabase running (`npm start`).
- **Combined.** `npm test` runs end2end then unit.

E2E specifics:

- **Shared seed, shared helpers.** All specs share the one Supabase DB seeded by [supabase/seed.sql](supabase/seed.sql); use the `SEED` constants and `sql()` helper from [end2end/test-utils.ts](end2end/test-utils.ts) rather than re-declaring UUIDs or `psql` wrappers. Restore any shared row you mutate (usually in a `finally`). [end2end/global-setup.ts](end2end/global-setup.ts) resets the DB before each local run, so no manual `npm run reset` is needed.
- **Hydration barrier.** Keep `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` before a Svelte interaction (card-expand click, bound `fill`) — on this SSR app the page looks ready before handlers are wired, so an early click is silently dropped. Only safe to drop before a pure assertion.
- **Auth** is the real email-OTP flow via Mailpit (`login()`/`logout()` in [src/routes/login.ts](src/routes/login.ts)), with backoff retries against GoTrue's rate limit.
- **CI** ([.github/workflows/playwright.yml](.github/workflows/playwright.yml)) shards across a runner matrix (`--shard`), each shard its own fresh Supabase. Resize via `SHARD_TOTAL` + the `matrix.shard` list (keep in sync); floor is per-runner setup + the slowest single file. Supabase images are cached; `merge-reports` stitches shard blobs into one HTML report on failure; `retries: 2`.

## Local development

```sh
npm install
npm run start       # supabase start (skips storage, imgproxy, logflare, supavisor, vector) + serves edge functions
npm run dev         # Vite dev server
npm run reset       # supabase db reset + regenerate src/data/database.ts
npm run check:now   # one-shot svelte-check
npm run locale      # validate locales
npm run stop        # supabase stop
```

`.env` (gitignored) supplies `RESEND_API_KEY` and any other secrets. Without it, the `resend` function logs to the console rather than sending mail, which is the intended local-dev behavior.
